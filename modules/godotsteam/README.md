Known Issues
---
- **Using MinGW causes crashes.** I strongly recommend you **do not use MinGW** to compile at this time.
- **As of Steamworks SDK 1.53,** you cannot compile with previous version of GodotSteam (3.11.1 or earlier) due to a code change in the SDK.
  - Using _**Steamworks SDK 1.53 or newer**_, you must use _**GodotSteam 3.12 or newer**_.
  - Using _**Steamworks SDK 1.53 or earlier**_, you must use _**GodotSteam 3.11.1 or earlier**_.

"Quick" How-To
---
For complete instructions on how to build the Godot 3.x version of GodotSteam from scratch, [please refer to our documentation's 'How-To Modules' section.](https://godotsteam.com/howto/modules/) It will have the most up-to-date information.

Alternatively, you can just [download the pre-compiled versions in our Releases section](https://github.com/CoaguCo-Industries/GodotSteam/releases) and skip compiling it yourself!
